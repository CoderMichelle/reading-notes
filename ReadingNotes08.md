Road 08 Operators and Loops

There are comparison Operators and Logical Operators
Comparison operators usually return a single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more that one comparison operator.

Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. There are three common types of loops:
For- (most common) used to tell how many times the loop should run, or if you need to run code a specific # of times
While - if you donâ€™t know how many times needed to run, will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true.
Do While- similar to while, except it will always run the statements inside curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.

Loop Counters - A for loop uses a counter as a condition. This instructs the code to run a specified number of times. The condition is made up of three statements:
Initialization- create a variable and set it to 0. this variable is commonly called I, and it acts as the counter.
Condition- The loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a specified number.
Update- Every time the loop has run the statements in the curly braces, it adds one to the counter.
