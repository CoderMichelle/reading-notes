# BUILDING A WEBSITE
- It's important to know who you are targeting/your audience, why they would come to your site, and what they are looking for
- Using Site Maps helps
- Wireframes allow you to organize the info
- Using visual hierarchy and differentiate between pieces of info using size, color, and style
- It's all about getting your message across using design
- Use grouping and similarity to help
- Think Symmantics, and don't do DIVs
- Build a model/sketch mock up first so you have an idea of where you are grouping
- HTML pages are text documents
- HTML uses *tags* or *elements* to describe the structure of pages
- Attributes made up of a name and a value tell us more about the contents of the elements
