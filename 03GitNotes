> Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project 
to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.
A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.
> (CVCS) system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. This streamlined the collaboration process (by eliminating the need to involve all local databases), allowed programmers to have more knowledge of team membersâ€™ activities with certain files, and gave administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges.
>A Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information. 
> Git is the GATEKEEPER.
