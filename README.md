## MY GROWTH MINDSET REMINDERS

## *Intelligence Can Be Developed*

## REMEMBER TO ALWAYS
* Embrace Challenges
* Persist in the face of setbacks
* See effort as the path to mastery
* Learn from criticism
* Find lessons and inspriation in the success of others

## If I make a mistake it proves that I put in an effort and trying a new strategy will give me a way foreward.
