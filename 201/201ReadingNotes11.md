# The Basics
+ SEO is the practice of trying to help a website appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that website covers.
# On-page Techniques

+ Methods we can use on our webpages to improve their rating in search engines.
The main component of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine, and then including these in the text and HTML code
# Off-pages Techniques

+ Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours.

## ON-PAGE SEO

+ In every page of website there are seven key places where keywords can appear in order to improve its findability.

1. Page Title

+ The page title appears at the top of the browser window or on the tab of a browser. Inside <title> </title> element.

2. URL / Web Address

+ The name of the file is part of the URL. Where possible, we need to use keywords in the file name

3. Headings

+ If the keywords are in a heading <hn> element then a search engine will know that this page is all about that subject and give it greater weight than other text.

4. Text
Where possible, it helps to repeat the keywords in the main body of the text at least 2-3 times.

5. Link Text
Use keywords in the text that creates links between pages (rather than using generic expressions such as "click here")

6. Image Alt Text

+ Provide accurate descriptions of images in the alt text.

7. Page Descriptions

+ The page description also lives inside the <head> element and is specified using a <meta> tag. It should be a sentence that describes the content of the page.
