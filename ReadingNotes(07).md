A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flow chart can help).

-	Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
